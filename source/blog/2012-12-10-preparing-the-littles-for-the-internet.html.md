When I asked my six-year-old what he hoped Santa would bring him for Christmas, he said &ldquo;you know… It starts with an F… A phone!&rdquo; When I informed him that he couldn&rsquo;t have a phone 
until he was sixteen, he said &ldquo;oh, well how about a computer?&rdquo;

I probably would have said the same thing if I were him, and he made the geek dad in me proud. Both the little mini-me&rsquo;s are given supervised iPad time as a reward and they&rsquo;ve grown quite 
fond of playing _Plants vs. Zombies_ and _Temple Run_ and watching Lego _Star Wars_ stop motion animations or videos on [how to be a ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdLCEwEFCMU) or 
[how to fold origami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSijU52XJ7w) on YouTube. If I had that shit when I was six, I would want unrestricted access too.

Now that the holidays are here, I began wondering what was the most appropriate way to introduce my kids to the web without just handing them the keys to Google. I&rsquo;m firm in my belief that web 
access is a fundamental human right at this point in civilization. The web is such a powerful tool for self-directed learning that I don&rsquo;t want to wait too long to give it to my kids. However, 
it&rsquo;s also like a modern mashup of the [Library of Alexandria](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Alexandria), the [Grand Bazaar of Istanbul](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Bazaar,_Istanbul), 
and the [Red Light District](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Wallen) of Amsterdam. Everything on Earth is represented on the web and Google has flattened it and made it all instantly accessible, not to 
mention the inherent linked structure of the web leads to all kinds of accidental, sometimes serendipitous, sometimes unfortunate, discoveries. Porn, people, I&rsquo;m talking about porn.

So I&rsquo;m not about to give a six-year-old a computer, but there are an impressive number of kid-friendly options out there right now. The best that I&rsquo;ve seen is an Android tablet designed 
for kids called the [Nabi 2](http://www.nabitablet.com). It&rsquo;s a powerful 7&rdquo; tablet, similar in specs to the Nexus 7, but is has a customized operating system with two modes&mdash;parent mode and kid mode. Parents 
have full access to the latest Android OS, but kids have a simpler sandboxed interface, showing them only those apps approved by parents and a set of kid-friendly websites in a browser that doesn&rsquo;t 
allow navigation off-site. It comes with a whole slew of prepackaged games and educational software, streaming music and age-appropriate TV. It doesn&rsquo;t have access to Google Play, so app options 
are limited to Nabi&rsquo;s built-in app store, which currently contains about 500 kid-friendly apps, and the Amazon Appstore which contains thousands more. It has a camera, which means the kids can 
take pictures and even Skype with their grandparents (or, more likely, each other from opposite ends of the house). And it comes with a robust protective bumper so you don&rsquo;t have to worry so 
much about damage when the inevitable occurs. It runs for $199 at [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/Fuhu-NABI-NABI2-NV7A-7-Inch-Tablet/dp/B008DBI5RI/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355372519&amp;sr=8-1) or 
[nabitablet.com](http://www.nabitablet.com).

It&rsquo;s a relief to know that I&rsquo;m not the only one thinking about how best to balance access to technology with an age-appropriate, phased introduction. We&rsquo;ve got a couple of Nabis 
on the way and I think this is exactly the tool we need to start the process.
