## Matt Olson

<div class="row">
  <div class="small-8 columns" markdown="1">
I&rsquo;m a [systems thinker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking), [hacker](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_%28programmer_subculture%29), and
[social entrepreneur](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_entrepreneurship) from Northern California.

I get excited by new technology and elegant hacks of all kinds, but my particular interest is learning how to apply the principles of 
[social business](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_business) to seemingly intractable systemic problems, such as global warming, 
wealth inequality, and the deterioration of human communities. These are emergent properties of a flawed system&mdash;a human system
that can be changed.

I am helping to build, as [Buckminster Fuller](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckminster_Fuller) once put it:

> a world that works for 100% of humanity,
> in the shortest possible time,
> through spontaneous cooperation,
> without ecological offense,
> or the disadvantage of anyone.

I believe in the capacity of human creativity and collective action to change the course of history. We live in a unique age when individuals and
small groups can build new tools and deliver them to a significant share of the world's population easily and inexpensively, spreading ideas and 
coordinating action as never before.
