The increasing size of the homeless population downtown has become a hot button political issue for Chico, and one that divides the candidates for the City Council election tomorrow. At the League of Women 
Voters forum on October 15th, I saw two very distinct points of view represented.

The first was best illustrated by the comments of Sean Morgan, perhaps the most plain spoken conservative of the group advocating for new laws against objectionable behavior. In response to a question 
about what the city should do about the homeless &ldquo;situation&rdquo; downtown, Mr. Morgan replied, &ldquo;My take is to give the police department the tools it needs&mdash;the misdemeanor vagrancy 
and panhandling laws they&rsquo;ve asked the council for before and been denied. We have terrific resources for the disabled&mdash;the Jesus Center, the Torres Center, that help people get traction as long 
as they&rsquo;re making progress, and they do a great job. To the others, I would like Chico to send a clear message, if you want to come to Chico to learn, add value and make progress, you&rsquo;re welcome 
here, but if you&rsquo;re here solely to party or bask endlessly in the generosity of our nonprofits, we ask that you move along.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s how you say &ldquo;run &lsquo;em out of town, boys&rdquo; 
in 2012. The audience reacted with hushed gasps of shock on one side and beaming pride on the other.

The other side was best illustrated by Tami Ritter, who said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s going to take a collaborative approach, both with Butte County Department of Behavioral Health as well as a variety of other 
service organizations, including the city. What I continue to hear is that we are legislating too much, and we are taking away individual freedoms, yet I continue to hear about how we need more legislation 
to make it illegal to panhandle or illegal to sit on the sidewalk or to sleep on the sidewalk. So I don&rsquo;t think this is an issue or a problem that we can legislate away. I think this is something that 
is going to take a well thought-out approach.&rdquo;

The consensus among the conservatives running for City Council seems to be that the presence of homeless people downtown hurts business traffic so we need new laws to criminalize their unwanted behavior. 
The consensus among the liberals seems to be that this is a complicated problem that cannot be legislated away, but requires a collaborative, multi-dimensional effort to get at the root problems.

I felt that what was missing from the debate was any indication that any of these candidates (with the exception of Tami Ritter, the founding director of the [Torres Shelter](http://www.chicoshelter.org/)) has spent any time in contact 
with the subject of their speculation. How can a politician make such an important decision regarding an already marginalized segment of our community without having talked to them? Just as importantly, 
how can I, as a citizen, know who to support unless I put my own assumptions to the test? So, over several days, I spent time talking with homeless persons in downtown Chico in an effort to understand this 
misunderstood and marginalized part of our community.

Toby Schindelbeck, another conservative candidate for City Council, correctly identified four segments of the homeless population that have different characteristics and different needs. At the candidate forum, 
he said &ldquo;you have the homeless that are down on their luck from the economy, and they&rsquo;re homeless because of that. You have the people that are mentally ill or vets, and both those categories need 
our help. And then we have the street life enthusiasts, who choose the lifestyle. They travel on the homeless highway from Seattle to Portland to San Francisco, and now Chico is on that stop. And then we have 
the AB109 early releases who are the most dangerous out of all of them.&rdquo;

But, when the average citizen or politician in Chico talks about the &ldquo;homeless problem downtown,&rdquo; they are most likely talking about the travelers&mdash;the young travelers with backpacks, often 
accompanied by dogs, sitting in front of businesses with provocative signs asking passersby for &ldquo;spare change.&rdquo; They are the most visible and noisy of the homeless that the average citizen in Chico 
comes in contact with, and therefore the most politically visible.

The two I spoke to in front of Jamba Juice, Charlie and Red, called themselves &ldquo;dirty kids.&rdquo; Red had tattoos on his calves: &ldquo;Clean kids get sick and die. Dirty kids get sick and live.&rdquo; 
They painted a romantic picture of life on the road, a carefree life of no responsibilities, near constant partying, traveling all over the country, living outdoors. Charlie had face tattoos and a scar on her 
chest from a heart surgery. She had a dog that was &ldquo;born in the snow&mdash;I hitched 250 miles to save her, and now she&rsquo;s mine.&rdquo; She had an ebullient, dynamic, joyful personality and a charming 
smile. Born near Seattle, she has been homeless since age 14, on the road for 12 years off and on. Of all the traveling kids I spoke to, she had the most romanticized notion of life on the road. She dropped out 
of school early, and briefly went back to try to finish high school, but when her grades were failing and she told her high school counselor all she wanted to do was travel, he told her to just drop out and do it. 
So she did. She loves the freedom, but also looks back with almost wistful memory of her previous life&mdash;her room filled with old Victorian things, a 1920s top hat, beautiful tapestries and little gold trinkets, 
not to mention a comfortable bed. Whenever she gets a chance to cook in a kitchen, as she did recently when she cooked biscuits and gravy for a group of traveling kids, she has &ldquo;secret housewife fantasies. 
I clean the kitchen and cook for everyone and I just love the smell of the kitchen.&rdquo;

Red is a bit older, from Pennsylvania, and has been on the road for twelve years. He has red hair and scruffy mutton chops and a broken front tooth. He is polite, respectful, and kind. He did not become homeless 
by choice, but began associating with the traveling kids, picking up tips on where to get food and how to make ends meet. He said &ldquo;some of those kids give the rest of us a bad name, but aside from being a 
little noisy at night when we&rsquo;re hanging out partying, we don&rsquo;t cause any trouble.&rdquo; He doesn&rsquo;t want to go back to a traditional life &ldquo;paying rent for something I&rsquo;ll never own&rdquo; 
and rarely stays in one place for more than a few weeks. He said &ldquo;about 15-20 of us sleep in the plaza at night. They&rsquo;re all a lot like us. We&rsquo;ve even seen a lot of them in other towns. It&rsquo;s 
funny&mdash;it&rsquo;s a small world, and we&rsquo;ll see the same people again and again all over.&rdquo; Asked where they&rsquo;ve been recently, he mentions &ldquo;Seattle, Portland, Bend, Klamath Falls, San Francisco, 
but Chico is an excellent place to winter.&rdquo; As we were talking, a friend came by to share a portion of a breakfast burrito from a nearby trashcan. &ldquo;People throw away all kinds of good food, 
it&rsquo;s crazy.&rdquo;

Digger is not a traveling kid&mdash;at least not anymore. I found him sitting in front of an empty storefront on Broadway. He was born in the area, became homeless at 14, and traveled for many years but came back 
to handle a legal problem and decided to stay. He said &ldquo;the traveling kids ruin it for everyone. Everyone blames the &lsquo;homeless&rsquo; but we&rsquo;re all different.&rdquo; He talked about trying to get 
a job and becoming bewildered because he doesn&rsquo;t know his Social Security number and the unemployment office wanted it, as well as a passport, which he deemed ridiculous. He also pointed out a common, and 
very basic, problem for homeless individuals&mdash;handling the security of your possessions. He complained about how &ldquo;punk teenagers and middle schoolers will come in to your camp and scatter all your stuff 
or steal from you.&rdquo; He said it&rsquo;s impossible to go to the shelters without a partner without being subject to theft. I heard this from virtually everyone I spoke to, and it is yet another impediment to 
getting anything done&mdash;seeking services at government offices or shelters, finding work&mdash;how do you keep your important, if few, belongings safe? Digger&rsquo;s immediate environment was clean and orderly. 
He had a small backpack and a small suitcase with wheels with everything neatly contained. &ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t have everything tidy and ready to go when the police arrive, there will be trouble.&rdquo; He 
showed disdain for those that make a mess in front of businesses and said he will &ldquo;clean up messes left by the traveling kids to avoid any trouble.&rdquo; Every few days or so, &ldquo;I save up enough for a 
room somewhere to get a shower and a good night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo; As for why we are seeing an increase in travelers, Digger says that &ldquo;towns all over are pushing people out, so people come here thinking 
it&rsquo;s a party town, trash the place and move on.&rdquo;

Bob is a Korean War veteran who receives benefits through Veterans Affairs, but not enough to afford a place to live. He supplements his income by &ldquo;doing this,&rdquo; he said as he waved his arms indicating 
his wheelchair and cardboard sign. He was dressed cleanly, and had just been to the hospital, evidenced by the admission band still on his wrist. The night before, he was near a restaurant when the owner came out 
with a whole pizza, and another passerby offered him a burrito. It was too much food for him alone, so he shared it with &ldquo;the asshole kids over by the 7-11.&rdquo; He went back to the restaurant and slept 
there overnight, waking up &ldquo;showered with $1 bills. They were everywhere, I guess people felt really generous last night.&rdquo; Bob is aware of local politics and quite critical of the city. &ldquo;They need 
to come down here and give people jobs, make new jobs.&rdquo;

John has been on the streets of Chico for 28 years. His face is weathered, and he has a speech condition that make it difficult for him to speak clearly. He is a survivor of a case of colon cancer that required a 
permanent colostomy. His meager possessions are found beside him in a utility cart topped by a sign saying &ldquo;canser (sic) survivor, disabled, need help&rdquo;. Spend one minute with John and you&rsquo;ll 
realize he&rsquo;s the real deal: a disabled man with a crippling medical condition and no resources. He has no bank account. He&rsquo;s on the street asking for compassion and help. Most of the time, he is 
ignored by passersby that find his presence to be an uncomfortable reminder of the underlying cruelty of nature. The rest of the time, he settles for pity and a few dollars or some leftovers. When asked what 
he thinks of the proposal by conservative candidates for city council to enact anti-panhandling and anti-vagrancy ordinances, he offers a cogent rebuttal: &ldquo;They need to live for a year on the street with 
no money, no bank account, nobody backing them up, and then see what kind of laws they should pass. They have a way of making themselves better than poor people. They need to start thinking about other people 
and not just themselves.&rdquo;

There are almost 2,000 homeless individuals in Butte County, and there is no single reason behind it. This is a diverse group of people, a microcosm of society as a whole. There are families that lose their 
source of income and are kicked out of their house. There are kids that come from abusive or neglectful families, so they run away and strike out on their own, never to return. There are kids that reject 
mainstream society and develop romantic notions of life on the road and soon find themselves so far removed that it is unthinkable to return. There are war veterans of all ages that can&rsquo;t make ends 
meet or have difficulty assimilating back into society after their experiences on the battlefield. There are the mentally ill&mdash;also a broad category with many distinctions&mdash;just trying to survive 
day by day, but unable to hold down a job and so find themselves on the street.

The criminalization of sitting on the sidewalk, asking for help, or sleeping in public is a far too simplistic response. We need leaders with a broad vision that can ask the right questions and engage the entire 
community, not just law enforcement, in the solution. If we take the easy way out just because we don&rsquo;t like the dirty kids, we&rsquo;ll make life impossible for people like John or Bob that are in legitimate 
need and rely on our compassion for their survival. Passing a law to sweep people out of sight so our skills of compassion atrophy even further is no solution at all.
